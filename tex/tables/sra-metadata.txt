CDS_100		CDS_100	RAD-Seq data for Gekko mindorensis: Sample CDS_100	We collected RAD-Seq data using the MSG protocol described by Andolfatto et al. (2011). Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

CDS_3030		CDS_3030	RAD-Seq data for Cyrtodactylus sumuroi: Sample CDS_3030	We collected RAD-Seq data using the MSG protocol described by Andolfatto et al. (2011). Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

CDS_55		CDS_55	RAD-Seq data for Gekko gigante: Sample CDS_55	We collected RAD-Seq data using the MSG protocol described by Andolfatto et al. (2011). Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

RMB_13552		RMB_13552	RAD-Seq data for Hemidactylus frenatus: Sample RMB_13552	We collected RAD-Seq data using the MSG protocol described by Andolfatto et al. (2011). Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.

For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.

Following digestion of 50 ng of DNA with the NdeI restriction enzyme, we ligated each sample to one of 96 adaptors with a unique six base-pair barcode.  After pooling the 96 samples together, we selected 250--300bp fragments to remain in the library using a Pippen Prep.  For each pool of 96 size-selected samples, we performed eight separate polymerase chain reactions for 14 cycles (PCR) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (NEB Biolabs) and primers that bind to common regions in the adaptors.  Following PCR, we did two rounds of AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 0.8 bead volume to sample ratio.  Each library was sequenced in one lane of an Illumina Hiseq 2500 high-output run, with single-end 100bp reads.
