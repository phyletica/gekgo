    The accuracy and precision of \ecoevolity divergence-time estimates (in
    units of expected subsitutions per site) when applied to data simulated to
    match our \spp{Cyrtodactylus} (left) and \spp{Gekko} (right) RADseq
    \datasets with all sites (top) or only one SNP per locus (bottom).
    Each circle and associated error bars represents the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval for the time that a pair of populations
    diverged.
    Estimates for which the potential-scale reduction factor
    % Details of the PSRF calculation are in the main text, so we
    % don't need this
    % \citep[PSRF; the square root of Equation 1.1 in][]{Brooks1998}
    was greater than 1.2
    \citep{Brooks1998} are highlighted in orange.
    Each plot consists of 4,000 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    eight pairs of populations.
    For each plot, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the proportion of
    estimates for which the 95\% credible interval contained the true
    value---$p(\comparisondivtime{} \in \textrm{CI})$---is given.
