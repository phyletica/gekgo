    The accuracy of \ecoevolity to estimate the number of divergence events
    when applied to data simulated to match our \spp{Cyrtodactylus} (left) and
    \spp{Gekko} (right) RADseq \datasets with all sites (top) or only one SNP
    per locus (bottom).
    Each plot illustrates the results of the analyses of 500 simulated
    \datasets, each with eight pairs of populations.
    The number of simulation replicates that fall within each possible cell of
    true versus estimated numbers of events is shown, and cells with more
    replicates are shaded darker.
