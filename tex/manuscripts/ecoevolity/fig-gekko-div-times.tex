    Approximate marginal posterior densities of divergence times
    \jroedit{}{(in expected substitutions per site)}
    for each pair of \spp{Gekko} populations.
    The density plot of each pair is color-coded to indicate whether the
    islands were connected during glacial periods (Fig.~\ref{fig:map}).
