        \item<1->[``Species-pump'' Hypothesis] 
            Repeated climate-driven fragmentation of the Philippine Islands was
            a primary mechanism of speciation for terrestrial fauna
        \item<2->[Prediction]
            Taxa co-distributed across islands within the same Pleistocene
            aggregate island complex (PAIC) will have divergence times that
            tend to be clustered around times when sea levels fragmented the
            islands
